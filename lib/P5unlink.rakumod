=head1 NAME

Raku port of Perl's unlink() built-in

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use P5unlink;

  say unlink("foobar"); # 1 if successful, 0 if not

  with "foobar" {
      say unlink; # 1 if succesful, 0 if not
  }

  say unlink(@paths); # number of files removed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module tries to mimic the behaviour of Perl's C<unlink> built-in
as closely as possible in the Raku Programming Language.

=head1 ORIGINAL PERL DOCUMENTATION

    unlink LIST
    unlink  Deletes a list of files. On success, it returns the number of
            files it successfully deleted. On failure, it returns false and
            sets $! (errno):

                my $unlinked = unlink 'a', 'b', 'c';
                unlink @goners;
                unlink glob "*.bak";

            On error, "unlink" will not tell you which files it could not
            remove. If you want to know which files you could not remove,
            try them one at a time:

                 foreach my $file ( @goners ) {
                     unlink $file or warn "Could not unlink $file: $!";
                 }

            Note: "unlink" will not attempt to delete directories unless you
            are superuser and the -U flag is supplied to Perl. Even if these
            conditions are met, be warned that unlinking a directory can
            inflict damage on your filesystem. Finally, using "unlink" on
            directories is not supported on many operating systems. Use
            "rmdir" instead.

            If LIST is omitted, "unlink" uses $_.

=head1 PORTING CAVEATS

=head2 removing directories *not* supported

As the original documents indicate, use C<rmdir> instead.

=head2 $_ no longer accessible from caller's scope

In future language versions of Raku, it will become impossible to access the
C<$_> variable of the caller's scope, because it will not have been marked as
a dynamic variable.  So please consider changing:

    unlink;

to either:

    unlink($_);

or, using the subroutine as a method syntax, with the prefix C<.> shortcut
to use that scope's C<$_> as the invocant:

    .&unlink;
